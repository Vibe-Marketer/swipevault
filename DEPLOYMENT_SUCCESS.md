## 🔧 Minor Items to Complete

### 1. Database Schema Initialization
The database schema needs to be pushed to the production database:
```bash
# Run this command with the Railway DATABASE_URL:
pnpm db:push
```

**OR** use Railway's built-in console to run the migration.

### 2. Frontend Branding (Optional)
Add `VITE_APP_TITLE` environment variable to replace "App" placeholder:
- Variable: `VITE_APP_TITLE=SwipeVault`
- This requires a rebuild to take effect

### 3. Seed Initial Data (Optional)
Run the seed script to populate the tags taxonomy:
```bash
pnpm run seed
```
